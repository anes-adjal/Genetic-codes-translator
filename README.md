Created this system when I was a final year student at the secondary school
to help my collegues of the scientific major in the translation between genetic codes when solving exercices.	
The student types the serie of necleotides he want to convert then press ok button in the right of the field to format it.
The student presses the button with the name of the serie he want to convert inorder to convert it to all other types of series.<img width="977" height="784" alt="GeneticTranslation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b684c5-c234-4bb3-b089-cd1b650a1f18" />
